            <p>Digital insecurity on social networks is a problem that has been growing quietly but steadily in recent years.</p>
            <p>As more people and businesses have migrated to online platforms to interact, share information and conduct transactions, opportunities for cybercriminals have also arisen.</p>
            <p>Cyber-attacks, such as phishing, theft of personal data and dissemination of false information, have become common threats in the digital environment of social networks.</p>
